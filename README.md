# Colima StatusBar

A small menubar widget to show the status of [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima).
Nothing too fancy, really.

## Installation

Either download the latest [GitHub Release](https://github.com/phkiener/ColimaStatusBar/releases/)
and extract the `.app` bundle yourself or use homebrew:

```sh
brew install phkiener/personal/colima-status-bar
```

Note that `colima` is being invoked via your `$SHELL`, defaulting to `/bin/zsh`.
If it doesn't work, your shell does not support the flags that are being passed... sorry.
